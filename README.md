# Fall 2022, CS425 Group 5 Bank Database and Implementation

Group members: Charles Saineghi, Kaya Jones, Shayan Baig

To run our project, first initialize the database with postgres (as the target data source/schema) and run the init_db.sql file

Then in a python console, run: 
>cs425-f22-group-5\cs425-f22-group-5> python main.py

From there, you will be greeted with logging in as a customer or employee, and given instructions on how to use our interface and options.
